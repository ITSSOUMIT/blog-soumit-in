## OSQuery - Performant endpoint visibility

Maintaining visibility into infrastructure and operating systems is **critical** for all organizations today—compliance, security, and your bottom line depend on it.

We all are aware, **visibility comes from data** - and this is where things start to get complicated. Organizations have a lot of endpoint agent options, most of which hog resources, require complicated setup, and mostly donot support cross-platform OS support.

This cross-platform  does agent exist. It’s called [osquery](https://osquery.io/) and it can collect and normalize data independent of operating systems while increasing visibility across your infrastructure.

### History
Facebook [created](https://engineering.fb.com/2014/10/29/security/introducing-osquery/) and [open-sourced](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) osquery in 2014 as a high-performance agent to monitor security on Linux and Mac operating systems. [Windows support](https://www.facebook.com/notes/351671475888126/) was launched in 2016, and stewardship of the osquery project [transferred to the Linux Foundation in 2019](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/the-linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-new-foundation-to-support-osquery-community/). A committed group of organizations and community members continues to nurture osquery through ongoing development and education.
